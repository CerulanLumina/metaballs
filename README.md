# Metaballs

Based on the work by Hannu Kankaanpää found at [https://web.archive.org/web/20161018194403/https://www.niksula.hut.fi/%7Ehkankaan/Homepages/metaballs.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20161018194403/https://www.niksula.hut.fi/%7Ehkankaan/Homepages/metaballs.html)

Metaballs - *(noun)* - Procedurally generated of blobby shapes

Repository is currently packaged as an application, which can be run from
the command line to create a window that contains a rendering of metaballs.
The window will respond to certain keypresses as commands, as well as commands entered into stdin.
See src/help.txt for more information.


This is a quickly made project to learn the basics of metaballs so I can
use them for world generation in game development.
